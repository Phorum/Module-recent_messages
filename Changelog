Changelog:
----------

2011-04-20 v2.1.1

    - Fixed newflags for the "Updated topics" view (they were never shown).
      Thanks to phorum.org user "noe" for notifying about the problem.

2011-04-06 v2.1.0

    - Added support for some ajax features. In 5.2, this can be used to do
      some ajax loading of messages within the recent messages page or
      within other parts of the Phorum site..

    - In 5.3, the new features will allow for loading recent messages lists
      from other websites, making it really easy to put a list of recent
      messages / threads on any website.

    - Switched to using the newflags API for adding newflags to messages.

    - Implemented support for the Phorum 5.3 option to list unread messages.
      In Phorum 5.2, this option will silently be hidden.

2011-01-17 v2.0.18

    - Improved the support for the Readable Dates module.
      Thanks to phorum.org user "noe" for pointing out date grouping issues
      that occurred for messages that were posted after the time limit
      as configured in the Readable Dates module.

    - Added new German language files by Oliver Riesen.

    - Added a Russian translation by phorum.org user "sailord".

2011-01-13 v2.0.17

    - Made "Group by date" the default for users that enter the recent
      messages page for the first time.

    - Added support for the User Avatar module, by letting the module
      setup the template variable {MESSAGES->MOD_USER_AVATAR}, which
      can be used in the module templates. 

    - Added protection against setting the show_amount to negative values,
      which would result in database error messages.

2010-04-22 v2.0.16

    - Modified the breadcrumbs path for this module a bit,
      to make it more clear.

    - Updated the Emerald template to do more of the styling using CSS
      and added a few minor changes to improve the layout.

    - Implemented a new feature to make it possible to let the
      "Group by date" feature use readable dates.

2009-07-22 v2.0.15

    - Added Czech translation by Phorum.org user timqui.

    - Added French translation by notre-planete.info.

    - Added German translation files by Oliver Riesen.

    - Added Spanish translation by Phorum.org user Diego.

    - Added a module template that is compatible with Phorum's
      "classic" template. Thanks to Phorum.org user treble.

2008-11-08 v2.0.14

    - Added support for adding an extra item to the popupmenu of
      the Jumpmenu module. This feature can be enabled and disabled
      through the module's settings screen.

2008-02-03 v2.0.13

    - Added support for using the Readable Dates module as the date
      formatter. A settings screen was added for the module, which can
      be used to enable or disable the Readable Dates support.

2008-01-25 v2.0.12

    - Fixed a problem where "Group by forum" would only show the forum
      name that belonged to the very first message in the overview.
      Thanks to phorum.org user "mshell" for reporting the problem.

    - Fixed a small code typo (with no functional consequences), reported
      by Steve Healy. This typo could trigger some PHP warnings, depending
      on the PHP configuration.

    - The HTML title is now set to "Recent Messages" as well when the user
      is browsing the recent messages. Thanks to Phorum user "hcgtv" for
      the suggestion.

2008-01-23 v2.0.11

    - Included language strings for "OlderMessages" and "NewerMessages"
      in the package, because they are no longer available as standard
      language strings in Phorum 5.2. For forums that use a clean
      5.2 only language file, this resulted in the "Older messages"
      and "Newer messages" links being invisible in the interface.
      Thanks to CBiLL for noticing.

2008-01-08 v2.0.10

    - Some small updates to the emerald module template to make it match
      the Phorum list page template a bit more (using the same class and
      heading tag for the subjects, so only new messages will show up in
      bold).

2008-01-03 v2.0.9

    - The icons in front of the topics are supposed to link to some useful
      location (like the message, the last message in a thread or to the
      first new message in a thread). This did not work when grouping
      messages by their forum or folder. This release fixes this problem.
      Thanks to Thomas for noticing.

    - Added updated German translation files by Berti.

2008-01-02 v2.0.8

    - A problem sneaked into the pull down menu. If you are using multiple
      folders, then the pull down menu items might be incorrectly
      ordered. This release fixes that problem.

    - A standard Phorum function is now used for building the pull down
      forum menu. If you see empty folders appear in the list, then you
      will need to upgrade to Phorum 5.2.5 or up. This problem has been
      fixed in the core code.

2008-01-01 v2.0.7

    - Fixed a compatibility problem in case the Phorum pages are served
      as content type application/xhtml_xml.

    - For the "Group by date" view in combination with "Updated topics",
      the grouping headers are now the dates on which the last updates
      were done for the topic threads instead of the start dates for
      the topics.

2007-12-31 v2.0.6

    - Set the heading for the addon page to "Recent Messages" and cleared
      the page description to not show the (v)root's description.

    - Added "Recent Messages" to the breadcrumbs navigation.

    - Fixed a problem with the "Group by folder" view, which did not show
      full folder paths for the grouping headers, only the top level
      folder. Thanks to Berti for reporting the problem.

2007-12-17 v2.0.5

    - Fixed an undefined index warning as reported by Steve Healy.

2007-12-12 v2.0.4

    - Omit empty folders from the folder list.
      Thanks to Steve Healy for the suggestion.

    - Added German language file. Thanks Hiiri!

    - Implemented {MESSAGE->URL->LAST_POST} for use in the templates.

2007-10-27 v2.0.2
